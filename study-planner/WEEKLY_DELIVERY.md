# Chapter delivery contract

## Current instruction

The study plan and every study-facing chapter are written in clear, precise English. Study dates and hours describe the student's reading; they do not impose a chapter-production schedule. Work on one chapter at a time until it passes the source, mathematical, pedagogical, and presentation checks below. The active chapter and its status are recorded in `research/chapter-gate.json`.

Archived Iranian master's and doctoral entrance-exam booklets are **deferred until the final month**. Do not mine, classify, reproduce, or solve those archived questions while writing the present chapters. In the final month, the student and assistant will solve them together, one question at a time, and use the results for targeted revision. Do not ask the student to answer test questions during the first reading.

## University-course selection

For each chapter, survey a broad pool of relevant written courses from leading universities. Record the candidate university, instructor, title, year, directly accessible lecture text or slides, exact chapter coverage, actual review level, strength, and limitation. Evaluate source quality for **that chapter**, not just the university brand. At least four distinct course texts from four universities must genuinely be read, compared, and synthesized. Four is a minimum; add further sources when they resolve a documented gap. A syllabus, promotional page, or video without usable text does not count toward the four.

It is impossible to prove that every course worldwide was found or that a selected set is globally best. The source register must state the search boundary and access limits honestly. Never describe a catalogue-only course as fully reviewed.

## Required chapter content

1. State the chapter boundary, prerequisites, exact university sources, and actual review level.
2. Teach concepts from basic definitions through advanced cases with precise semantics, derivations, proofs, formulas, counterexamples, and all identified in-scope exceptions.
3. Provide five to ten demanding, fully worked problems with independent wording and complete solution steps. Attribute any adapted course exercise; do not reproduce copyrighted source text without permission.
4. Add a **concise, high-yield review sheet** of definitions, decision rules, common mistakes, and later timed-problem pitfalls. This is an important companion to the full explanation, not a replacement for it.
5. Add a diagram or interactive model when it makes a difficult dependency or dynamic behavior clearer; state what the model does and does not simulate.
6. End with exact references and a truthful statement of unresolved limits.

Length follows instructional need. Do not inflate pages through repetition, decorative spacing, copied lecture prose, or unrelated topics. Distinguish full teaching from the deliberately concise review sheet.

## Accuracy gate

Before setting a chapter to `ready`, compare its topic matrix with the selected course texts; check every formula transformation, theorem assumption, worked answer, edge case, attribution, source link, and print/mobile presentation. Keep a chapter `draft` while a known mathematical error or in-scope gap remains. Use independent finite checks where meaningful, without presenting a test script as a proof of general first-order claims.

The target is to remove every **identified** error and in-scope omission. A literal 100% guarantee about all unseen future questions or all courses in the world cannot be established. State residual uncertainty precisely rather than using an unsupported perfection claim.

The study-facing output is `dist/chapters/<topicId>.html`, generated from a reviewed English manuscript. The chapter index is `dist/lessons.json`. The English schedule is `dist/schedule.en.json`; the Persian schedule input is retained only as archival internal data. After delivery of one chapter, the existing chapter gate requires explicit user approval before work starts on the next chapter.
